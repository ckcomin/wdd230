                <h3>Wix</h3>
                <a href="https://www.wix.com/">Wix.com</a>
                <div><img src="images/VisualHierarchy.PNG" alt="mobile website image of Wix"></div>
                <p>The Wix website helps demonstrate visual hierarchy through font size and color. As we look at the page we can first see "Create a website without limits in a large font. This draws the eye and lets the viewer know the point of this website. We can also see the "Get Started" button in a bright colour. This gets the attention to something important for the viewer to click on. </p>

            <section id="proximity">
                <div class="sectionheader">Proximity</div>
                <h3>National Geographic</h3>
                <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/">Nationalgeographic.com</a>
                <div><img src="images/Proximity.PNG" alt="mobile website image of National Geographic"></div>
                <p>The National Geographic website helps demonstrate proximity through the use of white space. Between each diffrent section on the website there is white space to signify there is no relationship between the two things. Since the market section and the offer sections are separate from each other, it tells the viewer that they are not related.</p>

            <section id="contrast">
                <div class="sectionheader">Contrast</div>
                <h3>Bohme</h3>
                <a href="https://bohme.com/">Bohme.com</a>
                <div><img src="images/Contrast.PNG" alt="mobile website image of Bohme"></div>
                <p>The Bohme website helps demonstrate contrast through the use of colour and size. On the website we can perfectly see the product in a picture with contrasting colours and a big size. Since the picture is not the same colour as the text or background we can easily tell what the website's purpose is. Also the picture of the clothes is much larger than anything else on the website making it contrast even more. </p>
